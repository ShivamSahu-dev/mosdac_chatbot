The SMAP Sea Surface Salinity observed at {t} rsub {f} -14 is interpolated onto the particle positions that day. iv. With this, each particle has an SSS value on {t} rsub {f} day that corresponds to the observation at {t} rsub {f} -14 ."

        "text": "This algorithm is applicable only in the region with moderate to high eddy kinetic energy and where lateral advection dominates. High resolution sea surface salinity product generated by Lagrangian technique can have error due to tracer bias (depends on accuracy of initial conditions) and advection bias (Passive stirring can introduce bias due to mixing physics (air-sea fluxes, mixing etc.))."
